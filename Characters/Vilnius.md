## Playing Vilnius

- Appearance
	- Vilnius wears scorched robes
	- his unkempt hair is half burned away
	- and his face and arms are covered with blisters from magic fire
- He is the apprentice of [[Jakarion]], the dead wizard in [[The Amber Temple (X)#X17. Upper West Hall]]
- After the flameskulls there incinerated his master, the wounded Vilnius retreated here
	- He eats vermin to survive
- The amber golem has been patrolling the hallway outside ([[The Amber Temple (X)#X8. Upper East Hall]]), and Vilnius won't leave this room until he knows the golem has been destroyed

- Vilnius is a greedy, treacherous coward
- He curses his dead master for leading them to this wretched land
- If the characters try to befriend him, he is suspicious of their intentions
- He would like to retrieve his dead master's staff and spellbook, but otherwise he has no interest in exploring more of the [[The Amber Temple (X)|Amber Temple]]

## History/Info

Vilnius carries his spellbook, which contains all the spells he has prepared. He also has a gold amulet shaped like an upside-down V hidden under his robes. Of exquisite design, the amulet is worth 1,000 gp. It is the control amulet for the shield guardian in [[The Amber Temple (X)#X35. Sleeping Guardian]].

Although he can tell that the amulet is magical, he doesn't know its purpose. The amulet thrums when it comes within 10 feet of the shield guardian. If Vilnius realizes what the amulet does, he won't part with it.
