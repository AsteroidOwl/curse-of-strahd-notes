## Playing Exethanter

## History/Info

The [[Lich]] has fewer hit points than normal (99 hit points), doesn't remember its name ([[Exethanter]]), and has forgotten all of its prepared spells. It does know its cantrips. In its current condition, the lich has a challenge rating of 10 (5,900 XP). A [[Greater Restoration]] spell restores the lich's memory and all of its spells. Another casting of the spell restores its normal hit point maximum (135).

If the characters restore its memory, the lich gives them the passwords to all the locked doors in the Amber Temple (with the exception of the door into [[#X28. Hidden Phylactery]], where its phylactery is hidden). It also provides all the information pertaining to [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] and the temple presented at the start of this chapter. If the characters think to ask, it provides them with the command words for any of the books in the library ([[#X30. Preserved Library]]).

If the characters restore its body, it offers to escort them while they explore the temple. The other creatures that inhabit the temple don't threaten the characters as long as the lich is with them.

The lich defends itself if attacked and turns to dust if it is reduced to 0 hit points.

The lich assumes that the characters have come seeking knowledge and power. If it is inclined to help them, it tells them [[#**Amber Sarcophagi**|how the amber sarcophagi work]]. The lich has no alliance with or animosity toward [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]], and no interest in challenging [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] for control of Barovia.
